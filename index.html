      <p>I love building websites with CSS3, HTML5, Javascript, jQuery, and WordPress.</p>
      <p>For fun, I play card, computer, and table-top rpg games. I sketch, paint, knit, write, and occasionally sing. My toddler-wrangling skills are top-notch. My pizza-creating game is on point. In my life, there is never a bad time to drink some (decaf) coffee.</p>
